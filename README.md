## Aim of this repository
- To create a open-source central location where students can find all notes and learning materials.
- To reduce the burden on one person by collaborative contributions.
## Why are we using Github?
Github has many features which allows multiple people to contribute to the same folder/project/data
- Companies expect all CSE students to know how to use git and github because it is used almost everywhere.
- Git is like Google Drive
- Git allows anyone to request for new data (notes in our case) from the whole world (because anyone in the world can add new data/notes)
- Git protects the old data/notes by keeping it separate from the newly added data by random strangers
